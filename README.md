# Simple-Timer-Using-Arduino-Uno
This repo is the result of learning and exploring microcontrollers that can be used to create a simple timer using several components and electrical circuits.

# What you need to make this project?
1. Microcontroller Arduino Uno or Similar [Ardunio Mega, Nano, or Mikro]
2. 5Pcs Resistor (10k ohm)
3. 4Pcs Seven Segment
4. 1Pcs Pushbutton
5. 2Pcs breadboard to make simple and easier circuit
6. Arduino Software IDE

# How to make?
### First, if you already have all the ingredients, please arrange them like the following picture:
